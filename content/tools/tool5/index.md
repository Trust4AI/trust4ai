GENIE facilitates the deployment and execution of Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool is specifically designed to integrate with MUSE, which generates test cases following a Metamorphic Testing approach, and GUARD-ME, which analyzes LLM responses to such test cases for the detection of possible biases.

Integration options include a Docker image that launches a REST API with interactive documentation, simplifying its use and integration into various systems. GENIE is part of the Trust4AI research project.

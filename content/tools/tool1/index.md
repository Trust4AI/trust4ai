POET is a template-based prompt generator for testing large language models (LLMs). It leverages customizable JSON templates to create diverse prompts, enabling comprehensive evaluation across various scenarios and inputs. This tool is complementary to EVA, a tool for classifying text inputs. Integration options include a Docker image launching a REST API with interactive documentation, facilitating its use and integration. POET is part of the Trust4AI research project.

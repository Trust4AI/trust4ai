title:  MUSE. AI-driven Metamorphic Testing Inputs Generator
summary:  |
  MUSE generates test inputs for testing the bias of AI-enabled Search Engines. It leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a wide range of source and follow-up test cases. This tool complements GENIE, which manages communication with LLMs, and GUARD-ME, which checks for bias in responses from the systems under test.<br>
  To use MUSE follow the instructions in the github link below.

MUSE generates test inputs for testing the bias of AI-enabled Search Engines. It leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a wide range of source and follow-up test cases. This tool complements GENIE, which manages communication with LLMs, and GUARD-ME, which checks for bias in responses from the systems under test.

Integration options include a Docker image that launches a REST API with interactive documentation, simplifying its use and integration into various systems. MUSE is part of the Trust4AI research project.
